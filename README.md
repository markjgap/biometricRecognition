Biometrics are physiological human characteristics used as metrics to identify people. Historically the most common biometric has been the fingerprint, which is effective. However, fingerprints can be rubbed off and lost if the person does a lot of physical labor. Because of this, several other parts of the body are used for biometrics; some examples include palm veins, face recognition, DNA, palm print, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina, and recently ears have been a subject of research. Alternative forms of verification are things such as identification cards, social security numbers, and passwords. Biometrics are safer though because they are unique to the individual are much harder to duplicate.
	Having multiple biometrics to use presents a more reliable way of identifying people because body parts can change. Fingerprints can grow calluses, faces can develop scars, and hand geometry and palm prints can change with injury. As we have more ways to identify humans via biometrics, the more effective biometrics become. Using ears as biometrics is not as popular, though research shows it is completely viable. Because having more avenues to use biometrics for identification makes the use of biometrics as a whole more reliable, we decided to see if we could identify people using their ears with the aid of neural networks. With the use of a multi-layered perceptron with back propagation neural network, the program is successfully able to identify people based on their ears.
